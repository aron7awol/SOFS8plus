# SOFS8plus
Enhancements to original SOFS8 by James Finnie AKA jfinnie AKA bobof of AVS Forum (https://www.avsforum.com/threads/lg-oleds-3d-lut-profiling-using-lightspace-thread.3043520/post-61434336)

Added features:
1. Toggle WRGB/RGB
2. Toggle SDR/HDR
3. Specify gamma for SDR
4. Specify peak white in nits for SDR

Todo (Just need to port over from my separate patch gen script already written):
1. Limit peak white in HDR patch gen to something below 10,000 nits
2. Limit gamut in HDR patch gen to something smaller than 2020
