# SOFS8plus
Enhancements to original SOFS8 by James Finnie AKA jfinnie AKA bobof of AVS Forum

Added features:
1. Toggle WRGB/RGB
2. Toggle SDR/HDR
3. Define gamma for SDR
4. Define peak white in nits for SDR

Todo (Just need to port over from my separate patch gen script already written):
1. Limit peak white in HDR to something below 10,000 nits
2. Limit gamut in HDR to something smaller than 2020
